<p>WIP<p> <br><br>

Hey! Welcome to my profile, I am H0llyFire or just H0lly for short. I am from Czech but I would say my English is good enough for communicating.<br>
My main interest is programming. I started in 2018, so I am still pretty new. Currently, I am mostly working with C# and C++ but I have worked even with other languages, like Python, JavaScript, AutoHotKey, and PHP. I also worked with HTML and CSS, but only briefly.<br>
My other interests would be gaming, learning Japanese and reading manga, visual novels, watching anime, and stuff like that.<br>
The point of making this account was to share some small things I did in my free time and to get some practical experience.<br>
If you are interested in me and you would like a smaller project realized for small change or if simple enough for free, you can contact me on H0llyFiree@gmail.com or you can get ahold of me on Discord: **H0llyFire#0285**
